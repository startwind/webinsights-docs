| <nobr>2024-05-05</nobr> | Focus, focus, focus. As WebInsights is primally focused on hosting companies we build a very nice feature for this target group. <br>With this version we are introducing the "hosting insights" category. We started with a list of all companies worldwide that provide hosting. It's more than 10,000 and we show everything we can extract out of the AS information, their homepage and other sources.
| <nobr>2024-05-01</nobr> | For all the business plan customers we have a great new feature. When uploading a list of domains you are now allowed to set the max age of already done analysis. If you chose that an analysis can be one month old the collection scan will be very fast, but the data is up to one month old. If you choose that you want recent data the crawl takes longer. It's your choice now.

| <nobr>2024-04-28</nobr> | We reached the next milestone. We now indexed 10.000.000 websites. As we are still in the MVP phase of this service this is a great foundation for our analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <nobr>2024-04-28</nobr> | WebInsights is the best tool to analyze a big number of domains at once. But from today on it is also possible to run an analysis for a single page. It will return all the information we can find about the page. If the domain is not already indexed we immediately start the scan. We also combined the multi reports with that feature. When you click for example on the majestic rank domains you get redirected to the single report of that domain.                                 |
| <nobr>2024-04-27</nobr> | A new week a new feature. The report page now has anchor tags so that when you copy the link from the browser and send it to somebody he/she will land directly on the right tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| <nobr>2024-04-22</nobr> | We taught our classifier some new rules, including CMS like moodle and weebly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <nobr>2024-04-21</nobr> | Our newest feature is made for hosting companies. Instead of uploading a list of your customers you can simple select the ASN (Autonomous System Number) of your network segment. We already prepared a list of 200.000.000 domains and their according IP addresses. This does not only help usability but also your data protection agreements. You do not have to share data. Additionally it also helps if you only provide servers and do not know every domain running on your systems. |
| <nobr>2024-04-21</nobr> | When analyzing a big collection it can make sense to know which websites are the most important of this list. This is why we introduced the website ranking. It is powered by [majestic](https://majestic.com/) and provides a rank for the top 1 million websites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <nobr>2024-04-20</nobr> | We added a new statistic to the report that make sense when one is doing an analysis for a ANS or hosting provider. It shows the most used IP addresses and the number of domains pointing to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <nobr>2024-04-16</nobr> | This time it is not a new feature we provided but sill something the user will like. We updated our infrastructure, moved to HTTP2,  changed the PHP version and paralyzed request. The speed improvement is enorm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <nobr>2024-04-14</nobr> | We started with the implementation of the campaigns. This will be one of the most important USP of our product. It is still coming soon but you can already see what we will provide in the end to our business customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <nobr>2024-04-12</nobr> | When showing the segments (formally known as personas) you can know see the actual rules that apply to those segments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>2024-04-11</nobr> | We love transparency. That is why we already show the most important upcoming feature of WebInsights: the campaigns. We are currently working on this feature and it is not finished yet but we thought it is a good idea to already show a little bit of what awaits you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <nobr>2024-04-11</nobr> | The report list got more and more complex so we decided to redo it. Voil√° version 2.0 is live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <nobr>2024-04-09</nobr> | It's like magic. We removed the big form for creating a report and replaced it with a wizard that guides the user step by step through the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <nobr>2024-04-07</nobr> | We worked on mobile and tablet friendliness.Reports and report-overview now fit on the screen without horizontal scrollbars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| <nobr>2024-04-07</nobr> | A small bit nice features. We now have a breadcrumb that represents the portal structure and provides better accessibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <nobr>2024-04-07</nobr> | It is now possible to delete reports just by clicking on the menu item close to the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <nobr>2024-04-06</nobr> | We are proud to announce that we implemented a new game-changing feature: **private tags**.<br/><br/> When uploading a new collection you can add your own custom tags. That means the individual possibilities to query in your reports are much bigger now. [Read more](../docs/features/collections)                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| <nobr>2024-04-03</nobr> | We extended the "State of Internet" report with the information about the most used top level domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>2024-04-02</nobr> | We always have a close look at the technologies websites are using This is why we added three new CMS to the "State of Internet" reports. It is the "GoDaddy Website Builder", Jimdo and "HubSport CMS Hub". Feel free to contact us, if you think we are missing an important system.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>2024-04-01</nobr> | If you are a heavy user of report generation the report overview can become crowded. This is why we introduced favourites. You can now mark your most important reports so that they will always be shown on the top of the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| <nobr>2024-04-01</nobr> | We crawled the first **5,000,000 websites**. This is only a fraction of the whole internet but for us it is the first milestone that shows that the technology behind WebInsights works and we can now shoot for the 200,000,000 domains out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| <nobr>2024-03-31</nobr> | We introduced a great new feature: report series. For the moment we only use it internally but in the near future we will also roll it out to all `business` customers. A series is a report that reruns in a defined interval. We use it to create weekly reports in our "State of internet" category.                                                              |
| <nobr>2024-03-31</nobr> | The "State of internet" category now shows the percentage of the used technology based on the overall websites we scanned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <nobr>2024-03-31</nobr> | Tooltips can now be found all over the place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>2024-03-25</nobr> | The default report now includes the most used WordPress themes. This paragraph will only be shown on recent reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <nobr>2024-03-18</nobr> | We decided to change the percentage for the WordPress plugins so they are based only on the number of WordPress installations and not on the number websites in total.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| <nobr>2024-03-17</nobr> | You can download all reports as PDF so you can share it via email or other business channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>2024-03-14</nobr> | Reports now have a public (secret) URL that can be shared with others. These URLs do not need a registered account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2024-03-14              | We are going [open source](https://github.com/startwind/webinsights-classifier). All the classifiers and aggregators can now be found on GitHub. If you like PHP or tricky pattern finding challenges feel free to join the group of aggregators. This PRO version is meant for non-technical users that do not want to set up a complete infrastructure on its own. |
| 2024-03-14              | Statistics in reports now got an additional field: percentage. You can now see what relationship is between all content management systems others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2024-03-14              | The report builder now shows the number of urls in a collection so you know the report size before running it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2024-03-13              | We are setting up the documentation area. Starting with only a view details about the main features. This area will grow the next weeks together with the feature scope.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2024-03-12              | The changelog is ready. And you already found it. At the moment very much happens in this project to it could be a good idea to have a look at the page from time to time.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
