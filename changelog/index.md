| <nobr>2024-04-06</nobr> | We are proud to announce that we implemented a new game-changing feature: **private tags**.<br/> When uploading a new collection you can add your own custom tags. That means the individual possibilities to query in your reports are much bigger now.                               |
| <nobr>2024-04-03</nobr> | We extended the "State of Internet" report with the information about the most used top level domains.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <nobr>2024-04-02</nobr> | We always have a close look at the technologies websites are using This is why we added three new CMS to the "State of Internet" reports. It is the "GoDaddy Website Builder", Jimdo and "HubSport CMS Hub". Feel free to contact us, if you think we are missing an important system. |
| <nobr>2024-04-01</nobr> | If you are a heavy user of report generation the report overview can become crowded. This is why we introduced favourites. You can now mark your most important reports so that they will always be shown on the top of the list.                                                      |
| <nobr>2024-04-01</nobr> | We crawled the first **5,000,000 websites**. This is only a fraction of the whole internet but for us it is the first milestone that shows that the technology behind WebInsights works and we can now shoot for the 200,000,000 domains out there.                                    |

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <nobr>2024-03-31</nobr> | We introduced a great new feature: report series. For the moment we only use it internally but in the near future we will also roll it out to all `business` customers. A series is a report that reruns in a defined interval. We use it to create weekly reports in our "State of internet" category.                                                              |
| <nobr>2024-03-31</nobr> | The "State of internet" category now shows the percentage of the used technology based on the overall websites we scanned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <nobr>2024-03-31</nobr> | Tooltips can now be found all over the place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>2024-03-25</nobr> | The default report now includes the most used WordPress themes. This paragraph will only be shown on recent reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <nobr>2024-03-18</nobr> | We decided to change the percentage for the WordPress plugins so they are based only on the number of WordPress installations and not on the number websites in total.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| <nobr>2024-03-14</nobr> | Reports now have a public (secret) URL that can be shared with others. These URLs do not need a registered account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2024-03-14              | We are going [open source](https://github.com/startwind/webinsights-classifier). All the classifiers and aggregators can now be found on GitHub. If you like PHP or tricky pattern finding challenges feel free to join the group of aggregators. This PRO version is meant for non-technical users that do not want to set up a complete infrastructure on its own. |
| 2024-03-14              | Statistics in reports now got an additional field: percentage. You can now see what relationship is between all content management systems others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2024-03-14              | The report builder now shows the number of urls in a collection so you know the report size before running it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
