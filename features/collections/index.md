# Collections

Collections are a group of domains. Those can represent your user base or any other meaningful collection. The important
thing is, that after you uploaded one collection you are able to create reports and analyses out of it.

## Examples

There are some standard use-cases that can inspire you but you are not limited by those.

- **List of the websites of your customers** - You want to know you customers better? Upload a list of domains they
  provided in your product. If customers do not hate to configure their website the email address is a pretty good place
  to start as well.
- **List of websites from a special industry** - There are lots of lists of domains for special industries at there.
  Upload those lists and find out what these industry websites have in common.
- **List of competitor websites** - You can define a domain list with the domains of your competitors. Normally those
  lists are short but can generate a lot of interesting insights.
