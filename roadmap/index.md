# Roadmap

WebInsights is new on the market. That means that a lot will happen in the product the next weeks and month. We have
the [changelog](../changelog) to show you when new features and updates are live. And we have this roadmap to show you what we are planning to do.

This is also **your chance** to influence the product. So feel free to contact us, if you have ideas for the next features.

## Version 2

The next version will **focus on hosting companies** and we want to answer some questions with this use case:

- Who are "my" customers?
  - As a hosting company I am able to upload a list of domains that are hosted on my servers
  - As a hosting company I am able to define my IP range and WI will automatically find domains hosted on my servers.
  - As a hosting company I am able to see industry my customers are active in.
  - As a hosting company I am able to classify my customers in predefined personas (e.g. small online shops or agencies).
  - BUSINESS: As a hosting company I am able to classify my customers in self-defined personas.


- What hosting products fit those customers?


- How to up- and cross-sell to those customers?
